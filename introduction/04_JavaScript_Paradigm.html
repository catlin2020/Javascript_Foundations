<h1>JavaScript Paradigm.</h1>
<h2>Event-driven</h2>
<p>Is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user <br> actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or <br> threads. Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and <br> other applications that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input.</p>

<h2>Functional</h2>
<p></p>Is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.<br> It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map<br> values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running<br> state of the program.

<h2>Imperative</h2>
<p></p>Is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same<br> way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program<br> consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing<br> how a program operates.
